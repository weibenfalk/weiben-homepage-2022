# Weibenfalk, the story so far ...

Once upon a time there was a boy who got his first Commodore 64 …

That was the beginning of a lifelong passion for pixels, digital techniques, design and creating stuff with the computer as a tool. The years went on and the boy went through the Amiga era and the rise of the PC. Nowadays the MacBook Pro is his main tool in his working and private life.


As you probably already guessed; That boy is me. I still live my life with pixels and creative thinking. And i always will. I´ve also been curious and had an entrepreneur mindset my whole life with a constant will to develop myself.

Maybe that´s why i´ve had so many roles in my working life. Over the years I´ve designed and coded hundreds of websites, created digital concepts and design, content managed cms systems, project managed creative teams and been responsible for large clients. The list can go on …
